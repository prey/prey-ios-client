Prey is the most complete anti-theft application! It lets you track and locate your lost or stolen iPhone, iPad and Mac laptop. Locate and recover your device with geolocation and many more features.

> Prey is a freemium web service for tracking and monitoring laptops, smartphones and other electronic devices, based on an open-source software agent that connects to a host computer, also referred to as the control panel. The host can signal the agent, prompting it to reply with information about its current location, and can trigger various other actions.

## Features

- Find your iPhone or iPad on a map through geolocation using GPS.
- Take pictures using the built-in front and back camera.
- Trigger a loud alarm remotely even if your phone is put on silent.
- Display a tailored alert message on the screen.
